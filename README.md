# WorldCasper1

WorldCasper1 is Casper 1.4, [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/)'s default theme, made translatable into any language.

For example, in _.hbs_ theme templates:
```
{{t "Get the latest posts delivered right to your inbox"}}
```

The 1.4 branch is Casper 1.4.

The translatable branch is [i18n-translatable-frontend](https://github.com/juan-g/WorldCasper1/tree/i18n-translatable-frontend).

For Casper 2.0 made translatable, see [WorldCasper2](https://github.com/juan-g/WorldCasper2/tree/i18n-translatable-frontend).

## Casper 1.4

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Casper 1.4 is the last release of Casper's original design, created to be compatible **ONLY with Ghost 1.0** and above. If you are running an earlier version of Ghost, you will need [Casper 1.3.7](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases/tag/1.3.7). For all other versions of Ghost, we recommend switching to the [latest release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) of Casper, with an updated design.
