# Contributing to WorldCasper1

Thank you for any contribution to theme translations, mainly new _.json_ files (based on the English default _en.json_) to translate more languages. See details on [How to Translate your Theme Into Any Language](https://themes.ghost.org/docs/i18n). You can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to merge to the default base branch `i18n-translatable-frontend`.

For contributions not related to translations, please submit pull requests to [Casper 1.4](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/tree/1.4), original version of Ghost's default theme, with blog-like design. [WorldCasper1](https://github.com/juan-g/WorldCasper1) is a translatable version of Casper 1.4, maintaining compatibility and adding just translatability. Contributions that are accepted into Casper 1.4 will appear in WorldCasper1 as well with later updates.

For the current version with magazine-like design, see [WorldCasper2](https://github.com/juan-g/WorldCasper2), a translatable version of [Casper 2.x](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

Thanks!
